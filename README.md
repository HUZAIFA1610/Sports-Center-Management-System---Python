# Sports-Center-Management-System---Python

Collection of projects during study term in University

**Introduction**

REAL CHAMPIONS SPORT ACADEMY is one of the fast-growing Sport Centers in Malaysia. They have employed many coaches to conduct classes spread out among different locations. The sports available are Swimming, Badminton, Football, Archery, Gymnastics, Volleyball, Basketball, Cricket, Tennis and Table Tennis. The coaches are paid on a per-hour basis ranging from 100RM to 500RM. The academy needs a system to store al coach information consisting of Coach ID, Name, Hourly Rate, Sport Centre Name etc. Within this system, students should be able to register for sports, add and modify their own details and also rate coaches from 1 to 5 stars. Students should also be able to access any information they might need post or prior to registration. There should be two user types, such as Admin and Student. Different Functionalities should be available for both user type and certain parts of the interface should require certain login credentials.
